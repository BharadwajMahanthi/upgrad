# Main Branch Projects

## Overview

This repository hosts multiple data science and machine learning projects, with a focus on predictive modeling and anomaly detection. Each project is dedicated to solving real-world problems using machine learning techniques, automation, and best practices in data science.

### Current Projects:
1. **FindDefault**: Predicting loan defaults using logistic regression.
2. **Anom**: Anomaly detection using machine learning techniques (placeholder).
3. **Upcoming Projects from UpGrad**: More projects to be added from UpGrad courses and capstone projects.

## 1. **FindDefault Project**

### Project Overview

The **FindDefault** project focuses on predicting loan defaults using **logistic regression**. The dataset includes financial information about loan applicants, and the goal is to accurately predict which loans are likely to default based on these features.

### Key Points

- **Logistic Regression**: The project uses logistic regression to predict loan defaults.
- **Automated Preprocessing**: Data loading, feature engineering, and model training are automated.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Why EDA Techniques Are Not Applied
- **High Dimensionality**: The dataset has many features, making traditional EDA less effective.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Reducing manual inspection due to the sensitive nature of the financial data.
- **Automation**: Focus is on building automated pipelines for feature engineering and model training.
- **Model-Driven Insights**: Insights are drawn from the logistic regression model itself, rather than visual data exploration.

## 2. **Anom Project** (Placeholder)

### Project Overview

The **Anom** project is focused on detecting anomalies in a given dataset. This project involves using advanced machine learning models to classify anomalies, particularly in high-dimensional data.

```

### Key Points (Placeholder)
- **Anomaly Detection**: The project will focus on detecting anomalies in the dataset using advanced algorithms like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Similar to the FindDefault project, automated data pipelines will be created for preprocessing and feature engineering.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine to explore the projects:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BharadwajMahanthi/upgrad.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Individual Projects**:
   Each project is contained within its own folder (e.g., `FindDefault/`, `Anom/`). Navigate into the relevant folder to explore data, models, and notebooks.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   You can explore the Jupyter notebooks provided in each project to see the preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training steps.
