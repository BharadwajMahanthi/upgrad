# Main Branch Projects

## Overview

This repository hosts multiple data science and machine learning projects, with a focus on predictive modeling, anomaly detection, fire detection, and future projects in deep learning and AI. Each project aims to solve real-world problems using machine learning techniques, automation, and best practices in data science.

### Current Projects:
1. **FindDefault**: Predicting loan defaults using logistic regression.
2. **Anom**: Anomaly detection using machine learning techniques.
3. **Fire Detection**: A deep learning-based system for detecting fire and smoke in images using CNN, MobileNetV2, and other models.
4. **Upcoming Projects from UpGrad**: More projects to be added from UpGrad courses and capstone projects.

## 1. **FindDefault Project**

### Project Overview

The **FindDefault** project focuses on predicting loan defaults using **logistic regression**. The dataset includes financial information about loan applicants, and the goal is to accurately predict which loans are likely to default based on these features.

```

### Key Points

- **Logistic Regression**: The project uses logistic regression to predict loan defaults.
- **Automated Preprocessing**: Data loading, feature engineering, and model training are automated.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Why EDA Techniques Are Not Applied
- **High Dimensionality**: The dataset has many features, making traditional EDA less effective.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Reducing manual inspection due to the sensitive nature of the financial data.
- **Automation**: Focus is on building automated pipelines for feature engineering and model training.
- **Model-Driven Insights**: Insights are drawn from the logistic regression model itself, rather than visual data exploration.

## 2. **Anom Project**

### Project Overview

The **Anom** project is focused on detecting anomalies in a given dataset. This project involves using advanced machine learning models to classify anomalies, particularly in high-dimensional data.

│   └── models/
│       └── train_anom_model.py           # Script to train the anomaly detection model
```

### Key Points
- **Anomaly Detection**: The project focuses on detecting anomalies using models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Automated data pipelines for preprocessing and feature engineering.

## 3. **Fire Detection Project**

### Project Overview

The **Fire Detection** project leverages deep learning to detect fire and smoke in real-time images using CNN, MobileNetV2, and other architectures. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes images categorized as fire, smoke, and non-fire.

- **Dataset**: [Forest Fire, Smoke, and Non-Fire Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amerzishminha/forest-fire-smoke-and-non-fire-image-dataset/data)
