```

### Key Points

- **Logistic Regression**: The project uses logistic regression to predict loan defaults.
- **Automated Preprocessing**: Data loading, feature engineering, and model training are automated.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Why EDA Techniques Are Not Applied
- **High Dimensionality**: The dataset has many features, making traditional EDA less effective.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Reducing manual inspection due to the sensitive nature of the financial data.
- **Automation**: Focus is on building automated pipelines for feature engineering and model training.
- **Model-Driven Insights**: Insights are drawn from the logistic regression model itself, rather than visual data exploration.
